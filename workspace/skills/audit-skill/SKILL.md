# Audit Skill

Produce an AgentOS operational audit for a requested time window, defaulting to the trailing 24 hours. The audit must use the best available local evidence from trace JSONL and session JSONL files, and gateway log files.

## When To Use

Trigger this skill when the user asks any of:

- "audit" or "usage report"
- "token consumption" or "how many tokens"
- "model calls" or "how many LLM calls"
- "task executions" or "task success rate"
- "operational health" or "activity summary"
- "review" or "rank"

## Mandatory Evaluation Dimensions

Whenever the user asks for a **review** or **ranking**, you must evaluate all four dimensions below. Do not omit any dimension, and do not treat them as optional or implied:

1. **Correctness**
2. **Completeness**
3. **Clarity**
4. **Actionability**

If the user does not specify a rubric, apply these four dimensions by default and present each one explicitly.

## Scope

Report these metrics every time:

| Metric | Source |
|---|---|
| Total tokens consumed (input/output/cache read/cache write) | Session JSONL: `llm_token_usage` events with `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`; fall back to `content_bytes` on `orchestrator_task_assigned` events |
| Total model calls | Trace JSONL: count of span records with `kind: "llm"` |
| Task executions | Trace JSONL: `run_started` events, or Session JSONL: `session_started` events |
| Task success rate | Trace JSONL: `run_finished` events, or Session JSONL: `session_finished` events |
| Cron job execution | Gateway log lines containing cron run/finish records (if available) |
| Model invocations by provider/model | Gateway log lines containing `llm provider=`, `model=` |
| Failed tasks with timestamps and details | Gateway log lines containing `"gateway run failed"`, `"resume failed"`, `"maximum turn count exceeded"`, `"guardrail"`, or `"approval denied"` |

**Important: The actual trace and session JSONL files in this workspace do not contain `token_counts` or `usage` fields on most records.** The `content_bytes` field on `orchestrator_task_assigned` events provides plan output sizes only, not input token counts. The `python3` interpreter is not available via the shell allowlist. The `llm_token_usage` event (when present in session JSONL) is the only source of exact token data including `cache_read_tokens` and `cache_write_tokens`. All other token metrics must be **estimated** from visible text character counts unless exact fields are verified present.

## Data Sources

Read sources in this order until enough evidence exists:

1. `file(operation="read", path="workspace/traces", include_metadata=true, modified_within_hours=24)`
2. `file(operation="read", path="workspace/main/sessions", include_metadata=true, modified_within_hours=24)`
3. `file(operation="read", path="logs", include_metadata=true, modified_within_hours=24)`

Then for each recent file, read the tail:

4. Trace JSONL: `file(operation="read", path="<trace-jsonl>", max_bytes=65536, tail=true)`
5. Session JSONL: `file(operation="read", path="<session-jsonl>", max_bytes=65536, tail=true)`
6. Gateway log: `file(operation="read", path="<log-file>", max_bytes=65536, tail=true)` or `tail` command if available

## Temporal Filtering

Only inspect files whose directory listing reports they were modified within the requested audit window. The default window is 24 hours, so pass `modified_within_hours=24` for directory listings.

If the user requests a different window, convert it to hours and use that value for `modified_within_hours`.

If a known directory has no files modified within the window, skip that source and mention it in the data source note.

## Incremental Retrieval

For file tool reads, use `tail=true` with `max_bytes=65536`.

If a returned file result says it was truncated, compute the audit from the returned tail sample and mention that the report is based on bounded recent evidence. Do not continue paging through large files unless the user explicitly asks for a forensic full-history audit.

## Extraction Rules

Parse trace JSONL and session JSONL by reading each line as a JSON record. Build counters by scanning for specific record shapes.

### Generate Timestamp

Use the current UTC time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` format for the `Generated` field. Compute the window start as now minus the requested hours (default 24).

### Model Calls (LLM invocations)

Count trace JSONL records where:

- `record_type` is `"span"` AND
- `span.kind` is `"llm"`

These represent LLM invocations (orchestrator planning calls). In the current trace files, spans named `"orchestrator.plan"` with `kind: "llm"` are the LLM calls.

### Token Consumption

Collect token data from multiple sources, preferring exact fields when available:

1. **Exact (preferred)**: Session JSONL `llm_token_usage` events contain `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens`, and `total_tokens`. Sum these across all sessions within the audit window.

2. **Estimation fallback — session assistant transcript text**: For each `transcript_item` where `message.role` is `"assistant"`, count the characters in `message.content`. Estimate tokens as `ceil(character_count / 4)`.

3. **Estimation fallback — `orchestrator_task_assigned`**: The `fields.content_bytes` field on `orchestrator_task_assigned` events (where `plan_kind` is `"reply"` and `target_type` is `"assistant"`) contains the plan output size in bytes. Use this as the output token estimate.

4. **Estimation fallback — input token estimation**: Count characters in the corresponding user message from the same session turn. Estimate as `ceil(char_count / 4)`.

Report exact token totals when `llm_token_usage` events exist and cover all sessions. When only partial or no exact data is available, label token values as **estimated** and prefix them with `~`.

### Model Invocations (Provider / Model)

Extract the provider and model from gateway log startup lines:

- `llm provider=<provider>, model=<model>`

Group LLM calls by the combination of provider and model observed during the audit window. If no provider/model line is found, use the most recent startup line's values and note the assumption. Show each provider/model pair with its call count in the Model Invocations table.

### Task Executions

Count `event.name` is `"run_started"` in trace JSONL, or `event` is `"session_started"` in session JSONL. Avoid double-counting the same run when both trace and session evidence point to the same `run_id`.

### Successful Tasks

Count `event.name` is `"run_finished"` in trace JSONL, or `event` is `"session_finished"` in session JSONL. A task is successful when its final recorded outcome does not contain a failure marker.

### Failed / Aborted Tasks

Count gateway log lines containing `"gateway run failed"`, `"resume failed"`, `"maximum turn count exceeded"`, `"guardrail"`, or `"approval denied"`. For each failed task, extract:

- **Timestamp**: The bracketed epoch timestamp `[NNNNNNNNNN]` on the failure line. Convert to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC`.
- **Status**: Use `aborted` for approval denials, `failed` for run failures, `error` for guardrail/other.
- **Details**: The message text after the timestamp, summarized to one line.

Currently trace JSONL and session JSONL may show failed tool calls (e.g. `tool_finished` with `status: "failed"`) but these are tool failures, not necessarily task failures.

### Task Success Rate

`succeeded_task_count / task_execution_count * 100`, rounded to one decimal place. Display as `XX.X% (succeeded/total)`. If task executions is zero, report `0% (0/0)`.

### Cron Job Execution

Look for gateway log lines containing `"cron"` or `"cron_run"` or `"cron_finished"`. If cron-related data is present, report:

- **Finished runs**: count of completed cron runs
- **Successes**: count of cron runs that succeeded
- **Errors**: count of cron runs that failed
- **Deliveries succeeded**: count of successful cron message deliveries

If no cron data is found in the gateway log or any other source, report `0` for all cron metrics and add a note: _No cron execution records found in the audit window._

### Gateway Log Trace Summary Lines

Gateway log lines like `trace: run=1, plan=10, llm=10` provide a quick summary of run/plan/LLM counts per batch. These are useful as a cross-check but less reliable than structured JSONL parsing. When the gateway log is available, extract these lines and compare against your JSONL counts.

## Workflow

1. List traces directory (`workspace/traces`) with `modified_within_hours=24`.
2. List sessions directory (`workspace/main/sessions`) with `modified_within_hours=24`.
3. List logs directory with `modified_within_hours=24`.
4. Read the tail of each recent trace JSONL file (`max_bytes=65536, tail=true`).
5. Read the tail of each recent session JSONL file (`max_bytes=65536, tail=true`).
6. Read the tail of each recent log file.
7. Parse each line of the retrieved trace/session/log samples to extract metrics:
   - Count LLM spans for model calls.
   - Sum `llm_token_usage` events for exact token counts (including cache read/write).
   - Estimate remaining tokens from `content_bytes` and character counts when exact data is partial.
   - Count `run_started`/`session_started` events for task executions.
   - Count `run_finished`/`session_finished` events for successful tasks.
   - Extract provider/model from gateway startup lines.
   - Extract failed task timestamps and details from gateway log.
   - Extract cron execution records if present.
   - Extract gateway log trace summary lines.
8. Compute success rate.
9. When the user asked for a review or ranking, include the four mandatory evaluation dimensions explicitly in the response.
10. Write the report using the output format below.

## Definitions

*   **Total tokens consumed**: summed from `llm_token_usage` events within the audit window, across all token types. When exact data is unavailable, estimated from `content_bytes` on `orchestrator_task_assigned` events and character counts in transcript text (`ceil(char_count / 4)`).
*   **Total model calls**: number of `kind: "llm"` span records in trace JSONL within the audit window.
*   **Task executions**: `run_started` events in trace JSONL or `session_started` events in session JSONL within the audit window.
*   **Task success rate**: share of task executions whose final recorded outcome was `run_finished`/`session_finished` without a gateway failure marker (`gateway run failed`, `maximum turn count exceeded`, `guardrail`, `approval denied`).
*   **Cron job execution**: finished cron-run records within the audit window.
*   **Model invocations**: call counts grouped by combined provider and model identifier from gateway startup lines.

Always populate every section with the best available data. Do not omit sections — if a section has no data, show zeros and add a note explaining the absence.

## Validation

Run `skill_validate("audit-skill")` after editing this skill. The validator checks frontmatter shape and body presence. Validation passes if the bundle contains valid `SKILL.md` with correct frontmatter.

## Known Limitations

- The trace JSONL files contain `kind: "llm"` span records (e.g. `orchestrator.plan`) but these spans do not carry `fields.token_counts` or `fields.usage` dicts. Token metrics are therefore always estimated unless `llm_token_usage` events are present in session JSONL.
- The session JSONL files contain `transcript_item` records with `message.role: "assistant"` but their `metadata` object is often empty (`{}`) — no token tracking data is attached.
- The `llm_token_usage` event, when present, is the only source of exact token data (including `cache_read_tokens` and `cache_write_tokens`). Its presence is inconsistent across sessions.
- The `content_bytes` field on `orchestrator_task_assigned` events provides output/plan byte sizes (37–164 bytes for tool plans, up to ~4000 bytes for reply plans) but does not include any input token counts.
- Cron job execution data may not be present in the gateway log; report zeros with a note when absent.
- `python3` is not in the shell allowlist. The `scripts/token_counter.py` helper cannot be executed in the current environment.
